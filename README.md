# JavaCoreExercises
Here's a few projects I had the pleasure to build and some exercises I had fun to solve!

-> Projects:
   - The Hangman game [you can play 1 vs 1 or with friends! The only limitation is that you need to have a file with a single word for each line,
     I suggest you to have them all in lower-case. In this version I just created a file with some uncommon italian words]
   - The Sudoku game [work in progress...]
   
   
-> Exercises:
   - The Fibonacci Sequence

NOTE: 
I used two YouTube videos as a basis to create the Hangman and the Sudoku game :D (you can find those videos on the channel "Coding With John", if you want to learn or improve your Java go check it out, it's one of my favourite Java Channels!)
