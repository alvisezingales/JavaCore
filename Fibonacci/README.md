0️⃣1️⃣1️⃣... The Fibonacci Sequence
</h2> 

Hi there, here's a program that will print the Fibonacci Sequence up to the number you chose, it uses longs so it can print up to the 92th element of the sequence!

The try-with-resources Statement and the Custom Exceptions are some interesting constructs I had fun to use here :D
