The Hangman Game

Hi there, feel free to play!
You can play 1 vs 1 OR with friends!

	I just let you know that in 1 vs Computer you need to have a file to read and you'll have to specify the file path in:
	
      		src > functionalities [package] > PlayerGuide [class] > readPlayerModeChoise [method]
		
  	The file I created (hangmanWords.txt) for this repository contains some uncommon italian words, but you can create
  	your own file and just add it to the file scanner, I'd suggest you to make it simple
	with just a single word for each line if you want it to work well. 
  	And I also suggest you to have the words in lower-case and without accents :)
