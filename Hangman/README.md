The Hangman Game

Hi there, feel free to play!
You can play 1 vs 1 OR with friends!

	I just let you know that in 1 vs Computer you need to have a file to read and you'll have to specify the file path in:
	
      		src > functionalities [package] > PlayerGuide [class] > readPlayerModeChoise [method]
		
  	The file I created (hangmanWords.txt) for this repository contains some uncommon italian words, but you can create
  	your own, just remember that it has to have a single word for each line for it to work well. 
  	I suggest you to have them all in lower-case and without accents :)
